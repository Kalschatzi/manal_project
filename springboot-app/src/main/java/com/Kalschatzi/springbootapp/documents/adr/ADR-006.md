###ADR-006:  Use Postman for API testing
Date: 29/5/2025

### Status
Accepted

###Context

As the application exposes RESTful endpoints, it is important to test them manually to ensure correctness and stability.
Therefore we need a tool that allows easy testing of HTTP endpoints.
###Decision

Use Postman for manual and automated API testing.
### Consequences

- Fast testing of API endpoints via a user-friendly interface.
- Supports test autonation through collections and Newman(Postman's CLI).
