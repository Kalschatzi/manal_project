###ADR-003: Use RESTful APIs with JSON
Date: 29/5/2025

### Status
Accepted

###Context
The application needs a way to expose backend functionality so that users can retrieve and interact with the data.

###Decision
Use RESTful APIs with JSON to communicate with the backend via API endpoints as it's easy to build in Spring Boot
via @RestController, easy to test endpoints via Postman or curl, and it's a widely adopted industry standard.

### Consequences

- Simple and fast to implement with Spring Boot.
- Easy to test with tools like Postman and curl.
