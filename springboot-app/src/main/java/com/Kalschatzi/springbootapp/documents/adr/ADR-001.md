###ADR-001: Use Java with Spring Boot for backend development.
###Date: 29/5/2025.

### Status
Accepted.

###Context
The application needs a programming language and framework that supports backend server-side logic, data fetching, persistence, and
RESTful APIs.
For the backend, the language and framework must support:
- REST API development.
- Scheduled tasks (periodic API calls).
- Easy and robust integration with a database.
- Long term maintainability and scalability.

###Decision
Use Java as the programming language and Spring Boot as the primary framework for backend development. Java is a widely
used and well-supported language in enterprise and large scale systems.

### Consequences
- Rapid, efficient development with many built-in features that support REST APIs, database integration and task scheduling.
- Easy integration with testing (JUnit), CI/CD and containerisation(Docker).
