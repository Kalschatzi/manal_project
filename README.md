# Manal's Project

This repository will document my learning journey as I build my skills to become a skilled backend software engineer, focused mainly on Java and other backend technologies.

## Description
Ways of working - Issues will be worked on as assigned by mentor and weekly progress meetings will be held where feedback will be provided with regular check-ins in between.

### Day to day:

* Issues must be regularly updated with current status
* Document every problem that you solve

### Code Rules:
* Main branch must be protected
* PRs need review
* PRs must have comments addressed
* PR checks must be green
* PRs need to be linked to an issue when raised - we should create a PR/Issue template
